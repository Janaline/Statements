# Deploring racism and violence in Australia: <br/>statement by members of the Labor Party

We are members of the Australian Labor Party from diverse cultural and faith communities, including First Nations communities.

We express our horror and disgust at the terrorist attack attempting to bomb a gathering organised by First Nations Australians in Perth to commemorate Invasion Day on 26 January 2026 - a day of huge significance to First Nations people. We are grateful the explosive device failed to detonate, thus averting what would have been a second devastating attack motivated by hatred towards particular communities in Australia within less than two months.

We strongly condemn all forms of violence and acts of violence that harm people and communities.

Many of us made a [statement](https://janaline.github.io/Statements/Bondi.html) expressing our devastation at the attack on Australia’s Jewish community in December and our commitment to stand together with all Australians against hate and division. We are heartbroken to have to repeat that commitment to First Nations Australians. We stand in solidarity with First Nations peoples and support their rights, dignity, and ongoing calls for justice and recognition.

Racist violence does not originate in any specific community. It does not affect only one community. Australians from many cultural and religious backgrounds live in fear of being targeted for their ethnic appearance, or for wearing headscarves or religious symbols. It is not up to any specific ethnic or religious community to take responsibility. It is up to all Australians to come together to take collective responsibility to eradicate all forms of racism and religious discrimination.

We join the Australian Human Rights Commissioners in urging the Government to implement the [National Anti-Racism Framework](https://humanrights.gov.au/resource-hub/by-resource-type/reports/race/anti-racism-framework) published in 2023. And we urge all of our fellow Australians to stand with us against the hate and division that threatens all of us.
